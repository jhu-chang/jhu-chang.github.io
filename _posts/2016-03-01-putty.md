### Here are some methods to execute the linux command directly from Windows via [PLINK](http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/)
* Directly execute commands:

  > PLINK.EXE -pw PWD user@host "command1;command2;command3"

* Read commands from file:

  > PLINK.EXE -pw PWD user@host -m path\to\command\file

* Load a saved session and execute command from file

  > PLINK.EXE -load sessionName -m path\to\command\file
